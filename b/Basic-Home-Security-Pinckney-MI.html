<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
