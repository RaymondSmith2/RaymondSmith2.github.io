<p>Another essential topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much photo details as 1080p.
