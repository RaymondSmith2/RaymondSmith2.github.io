It takes a 2nd for the camera to actually turn on when it finds motion due to the fact that the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording. They might get past the camera before it had time to tape-record them if a wicked wrongdoer was fast enough. Cellular phone can also now be used to remotely set and unset alarms through apps.</p>

With a wireless system, you can also receive push notices on your phone or tablet that let you know there is an issue, even when you're not at home.</p>

<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage option and others do not. For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage usually include either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage choice conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself. This choice is normally cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video clips in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is typically a paid service and the variety of hours it will store will depend upon just how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
