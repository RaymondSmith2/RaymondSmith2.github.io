Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with 2 Hive test systems detaching eight times over 2 months. Scout is very easy to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
