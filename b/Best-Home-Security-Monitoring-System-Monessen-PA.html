<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or aware they might be seen at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being watched by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You don't want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "individuals may find out to be cautious about the regulars and books they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or druggies." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals considered to be "out of time and place" with the environments underwent extended surveillance.</p>
