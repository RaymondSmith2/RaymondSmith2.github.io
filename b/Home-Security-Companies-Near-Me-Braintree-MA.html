<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
