CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense prevention method, which argues that opportunities to offend can be minimized by changing a variety of systems such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal offense, reducing rewards from crime commission, and decreasing justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas.

As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
