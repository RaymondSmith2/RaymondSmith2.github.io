<p>The loudest of the wise alarm we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at alerting anybody in your house and those neighboring that there's a problem. Throughout screening, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we like that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to account for family pets, too. The alarm system is just one of two we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it likewise comes with a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, even more discouraging anyone from attempting to break in to your home.

She was very effective and had the service set up for us within hours. Lt. Gregory was extremely responsive to all of our requests.
