<p>We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients realize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
