<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one?

The infrared energy emitted by an object is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it emits. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of detecting small distinctions in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and creates an electronic image based upon info about the temperature differences.
