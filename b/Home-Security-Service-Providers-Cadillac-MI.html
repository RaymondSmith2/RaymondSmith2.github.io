<p>To evaluate response times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of five times, utilizing contact and motion sensing units. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a personal security personnel. A number of cities likewise require an authorization to even own and run a home security system. Rules such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>

<p>The cover of darkness isn't adequate to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
