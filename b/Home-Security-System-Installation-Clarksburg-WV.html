Studies have actually shown that approximately 70 percent of burglaries that are not finished are due to the sound of an alarm. When the cameras were linked, we monitored day and night activities, including the comings and goings of 2 grownups, one child, and a pet dog.

<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an infraction.

As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
