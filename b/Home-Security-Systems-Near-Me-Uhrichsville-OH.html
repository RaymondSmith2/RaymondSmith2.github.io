<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.
