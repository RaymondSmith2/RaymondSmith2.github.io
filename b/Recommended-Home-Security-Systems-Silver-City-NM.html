<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, since it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
