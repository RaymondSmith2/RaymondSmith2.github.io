<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
