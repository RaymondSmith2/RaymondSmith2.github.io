<p>We searched for Do It Yourself systems that provided professional monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies supply complimentary or greatly affordable hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some individuals might wish to sign up for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and allow you to be in overall control of the equipment you utilize, in addition to how and when you pay and utilize for monitoring services.</p>
