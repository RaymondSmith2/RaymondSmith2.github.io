<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and absolutely like it. Terrific clarity. I wished to set up viewing on my cellular phone but had a couple concerns that the tech responded to with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter informs, for example. Nevertheless, those functions come at a relatively steep rate: $5 monthly ($50 each year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 each year) for 1 month of video history.

We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
