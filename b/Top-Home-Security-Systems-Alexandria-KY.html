The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
