<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. Audio and video confirmation methods use microphones and cameras to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image snapshots. The source audio and video streams are sent over an interaction link, typically an Internet protocol (IP) network, to the central station where screens retrieve the images through exclusive software.
