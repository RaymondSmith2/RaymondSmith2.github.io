<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
