Nevertheless, people need to take into account the frequency and period of their absences from home or business - instead of simply their tenancy. Who is home, when they are not? Who will react and hear to the alarm? And so on. If that system is not monitored, less than half the protection the customer expects is being supplied.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
