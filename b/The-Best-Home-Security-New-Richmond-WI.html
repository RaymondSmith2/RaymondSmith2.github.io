<p>Alarm monitoring becomes part of a total home security system.

<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, since it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
