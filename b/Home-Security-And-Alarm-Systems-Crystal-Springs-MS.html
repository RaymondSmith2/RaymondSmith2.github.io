<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>

Initially examine the providers return policy and 2nd keep the invoice if you do buy them.</p>
