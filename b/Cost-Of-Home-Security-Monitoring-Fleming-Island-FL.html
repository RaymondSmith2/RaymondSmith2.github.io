<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All things give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy released by an item is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of finding tiny differences in temperature. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based on details about the temperature differences. Since things are seldom exactly the same temperature as other items around them, a thermal camera can detect them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
