<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the entire community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a number of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you intend to store and how long you plan to keep recorded video. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage space rapidly.
