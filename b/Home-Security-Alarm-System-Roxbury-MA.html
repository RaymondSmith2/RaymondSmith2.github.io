Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.

<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was created for house owners. It must be installed by a professional alarm installation group and, once installed, is tough to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more typical for large residential or commercial properties and are typically more costly than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to remodel the existing wires in your home.
