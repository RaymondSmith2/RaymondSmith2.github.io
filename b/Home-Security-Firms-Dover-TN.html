<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
