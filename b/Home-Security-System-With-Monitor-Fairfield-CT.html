<h3>Home Security System Providers in Connecticut</h3>
<p>We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, signals, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
