<p>There are two outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped. The dome-shaped outdoor security camera is known to be less apparent to unwanted visitors due to the fact that they use a 360 swivel that makes it tough to identify their direction.

<p>Unlike wired security systems that run through your phone lines and can require more comprehensive installation, wireless systems can be set up in a matter of minutes as a quick and painless  Do It Yourself job.

Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is taping. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
