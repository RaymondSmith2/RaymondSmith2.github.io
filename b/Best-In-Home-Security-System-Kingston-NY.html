<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost.

However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute considerably to cops ability to collar intruders makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers support authorities response to alarmed properties) a costly and inefficient  approach to break-in decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
