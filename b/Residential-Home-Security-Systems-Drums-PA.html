<p>Various kinds of CCTV cameras. While burglar alarm innovation has established substantially because the 19th century, it is still based upon the basic concepts innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell.

DVRs transform the analog video footage to digital, which assists to extend storage capability, makes it a lot easier to browse archived video footage, and also permits users to stream video over a network for remote viewing from numerous locations. Often, the simple existence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated intruders. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more identified robbers. They might also be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks if burglars can not see any security cameras.</p>
