<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Need to be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
