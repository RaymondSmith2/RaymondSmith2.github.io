<p>TP-Link's Kasa Cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of view that might match a few of our top picks. It also features two days of free cloud storage (with a choice for more ), which can cram in clips of up to 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control panel and keypads, various sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. When making a decision, they are the only company of the four mentioned that uses a mix of wired and wireless technology so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you may also need a neighboring outlet. Many cameras require an Air Conditioner connection, which means you won't have the ability to put them just anywhere. Several of the cameras we evaluated offered the alternative to utilize battery power, but we have yet to find the best one. The models we have actually reviewed up until now either record extremely short clips, leave giant spaces in between those short clips, or need charging regularly.</p>
