<p>There are 2 outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped. Since they use a 360 swivel that makes it tough to identify their direction, the dome-shaped outdoor security camera is known to be less apparent to unwelcome visitors.

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, consisting of creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. However the Secure is costly, extra sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups-- is also expensive if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe might be too restricted for you if you have a bigger home or home you desire to keep an eye on. The only outdoor security camera that's currently offered is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is excellent for watching on visitors and plan deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your yard susceptible.
