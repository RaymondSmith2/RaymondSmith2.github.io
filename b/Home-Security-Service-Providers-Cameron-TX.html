<p>IP cameras are much higher resolution, enabling audio and video surveillance to be sent out over a network, with IP addresses assigned to each camera.

<h3>Small Business Security Systems Cameron TX 76520</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, ought to offer a minimum of a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to effectively find motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, however it may leave you with taping gaps throughout crucial security occasions. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd recommend among our top picks, however the Arlo is great for checking in on family and animals-- or stray felines slipping around your backyard.</p>
