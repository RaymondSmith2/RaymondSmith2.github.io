<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature.

As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store.

<p>The length of time does it typically require to flip to your alarm monitoring service? I use VOIP today.
