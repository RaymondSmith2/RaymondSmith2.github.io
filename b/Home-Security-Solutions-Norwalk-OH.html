<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the obligation of the entire neighborhood. As the name makes abundantly clear, you'll be getting a lot of the latter with a wireless security camera while simplifying your life at the very same time.

<p>Everybody we handled at NSS were extremely valuable and accommodating. The services they offered were exactly what we desired, and they performed with professionalism and proficiency.

Still, you're right about the Arlo Pro not doing anything to keep rain from striking the lens cover.</p>

<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to aim to make a camera with the most tough setup understood to man. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi details. (You should play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, dogs groan, felines scream, children weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>
<p>Integrated with powerful new software called video analytics, an IP security camera can be configured to "watch" for suspicious activity.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
