<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides free perks like person detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 per month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked only about 50 percent of the time and the camera routinely detached from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine).

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
