<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make consumers stay with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies suggests numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software and firmware.

It deals with Amazon Alexa, and it offers its own clever door lock, but you can't go installing lots of third-party devices with your SimpliSafe system. It does not work with Z-Wave or IFTTT, and we do not expect it to add additional functionality anytime quickly.</p>

For instance, you can have a clever plug turn on a light inside or trigger an external siren when the camera identifies motion.</p>
