<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't an alternative, you might want to explore hidden cameras, which are cameras that are discreet and small, in some cases suited everyday things such as clocks, smoke detectors, and magnets.

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you don't devote to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it indicates you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will respond. It likewise suggests that if you in fact saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could rapidly tape-record a message to him or her through your smart device, and the Nest would play it aloud.

Normally, a service call consists of a journey charge and a hourly labor fee. Since they vary from company to company, consumers have to talk to their alarm company to figure out these prices.</p>
