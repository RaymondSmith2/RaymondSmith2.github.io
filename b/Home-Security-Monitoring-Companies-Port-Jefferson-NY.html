Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of approximately one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have actually noticed some improvements since the camera's launch, and will continue to check and update this review, as required.</p>

Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's fantastic that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Cam.</p>
