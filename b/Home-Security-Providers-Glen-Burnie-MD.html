The answer depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you mean to keep and how long you plan to keep taped video. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage area rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage as soon as you reach the system's capability, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
