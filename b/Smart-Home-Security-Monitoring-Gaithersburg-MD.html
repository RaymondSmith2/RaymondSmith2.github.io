Cameras are also exposed to anybody who approaches your home, so you need to consider how your video feed is secured from vandals smashing the camera.

You will get the very best outdoor protection from cameras with a broad field of view, high resolution video, and continuous video feed that is published to the cloud.</p>
<p>Home security companies use a wide range of equipment alternatives, from mounted control board setups to fully automated systems controlled by tablets or mobile phones.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers totally free perks like individual detection, familiar-face alerts, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 per month.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked just about 50 percent of the time and the camera regularly detached from the network several times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine).
