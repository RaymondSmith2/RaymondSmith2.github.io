<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
