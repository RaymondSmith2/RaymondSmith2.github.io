<h3>Security System Companies in Salem AL</h3>
<p>When I discuss my deal with homeland security surveillance and physical security technologies, I typically get the Big Sibling is watching" comment, referring to George Orwell's omnipresent socialistic watcher called Big Bro in his book 1984. This Orwellian" fear is that someone someplace might be viewing you through a video surveillance camera this extremely minute and that somebody somewhere is abusing the system to violate your freedom and personal privacy.

<p>There's a lot to like about the Maximus Camera Floodlight, beginning with its camera's crisp, clear 1080p video. Its double articulating LED floodlights cover an extremely wide area, and you can dim them via its app if you want mood lighting on your deck or outdoor patio for a celebration. Additionally they can not send fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution snippets of video.

And for $30 monthly, you get 90 days of system activity in addition to expert monitoring.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by.
