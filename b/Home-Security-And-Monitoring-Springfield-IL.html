<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who happens to be my hubby).

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a regular camera image. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to fix detail after the reality, which indicates that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and use up a lot of recording storage area. A lot, in reality, that they need about 4 times the disk drive area of 1080p to tape-record the very same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
