They can track a person or a car throughout a range, or be configured to cycle through various orientations to provide you a a lot more thorough field of view with a single piece of hardware. They can also zoom and focus in on faces or license plates in real time. They're exceptionally useful as NVR cameras, considering that they can respond to user inputs even from off-site network connections.</p>
