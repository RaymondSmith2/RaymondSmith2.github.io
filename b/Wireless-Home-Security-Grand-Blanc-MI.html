<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". Wireless is the way of the future. Some leading home security companies offer expert installation, while others preconfigure your system at the factory and ship to your door for merely Do It Yourself setup.

<p>Some wireless security companies have additional functions and plans for an added cost. If you 'd like to have constant video recording and cloud storage for your security cameras, you'll have to pay a regular monthly or annual  fee.

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop.
