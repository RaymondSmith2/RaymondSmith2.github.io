We likewise experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test systems detaching eight times over 2 months. Scout is really easy to utilize, especially if you're a fan of mobile phones.

As well as being terrific for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for infrared and low-light given that the glass real estate does not hinder the lens.
