Outdoor cameras need to be weather condition resistant and in some cases, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most long lasting. Since their style allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor options.

<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
