<p>Another crucial topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend just how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The exact same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
