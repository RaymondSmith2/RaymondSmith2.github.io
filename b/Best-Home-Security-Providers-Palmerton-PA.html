This system may not be the best fit if you have a large yard or outbuildings to safeguard. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not require a base station-- it connects straight to any Wi-Fi network. But you can connect the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is offered for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web browser. Aside from providing easy access to recordings, the app allows you to change level of sensitivity so that you're not getting alerts every 2 minutes.</p>
