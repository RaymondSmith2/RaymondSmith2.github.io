The answer hinges on a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to keep and how long you plan to keep taped video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage when you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video that you still need.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
