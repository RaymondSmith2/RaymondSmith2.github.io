<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
