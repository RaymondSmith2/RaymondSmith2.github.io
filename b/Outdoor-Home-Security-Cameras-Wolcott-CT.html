<h3>Home Security System Cameras in Connecticut</h3>
<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
