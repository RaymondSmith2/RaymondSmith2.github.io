<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, scams, and theft. Idea: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We must once again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a certain level, you can make it instantly turn off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are activated, you can automatically make the smart lights turn on to scare away potential burglars.</p>

<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensing units, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most extreme frequencies created are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
