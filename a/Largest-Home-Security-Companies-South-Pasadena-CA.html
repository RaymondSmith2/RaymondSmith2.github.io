The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually progressed into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the exact same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
