<p>Home security systems and modern clever home abilities and compatibilities enable you to use their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone.

A second alarm signal-- received in a surrounding zone within a short time-- is the verification the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a fail safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
