No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
