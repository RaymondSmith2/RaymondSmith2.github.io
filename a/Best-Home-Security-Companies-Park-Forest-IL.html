Lookout is truly just a terrific name for a kit that includes a Wink smart home hub and a few security oriented sensors. You can't arm and deactivate the system. Instead, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't deactivate it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like trigger a camera to record or set off the siren. Read our evaluation here.</p>
