<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
