<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
