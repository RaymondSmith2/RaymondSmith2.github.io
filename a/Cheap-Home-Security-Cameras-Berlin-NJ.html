<p>Think of it this way, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more sophisticated video camera be sold for the low cost of forty dollars? It just does not add up. To offer such low prices, manufacturers need to cut corners, and the end outcome is compromised performance.
