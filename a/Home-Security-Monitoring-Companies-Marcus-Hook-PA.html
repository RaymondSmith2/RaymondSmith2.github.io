<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, theft, and vandalism. Idea: Often keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We need to again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating costly false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately shut off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are activated, you can immediately make the wise lights turn on to frighten possible robbers.</p>

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I tested, including smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
