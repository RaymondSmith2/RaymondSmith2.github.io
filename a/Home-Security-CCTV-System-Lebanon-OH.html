Cove has a full series of support articles and videos in case you get stuck while you're setting things up, however we doubt you'll need them.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras.

This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically via 110VAC power.</p>
