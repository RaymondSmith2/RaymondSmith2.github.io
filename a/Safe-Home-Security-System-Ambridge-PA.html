<p>When looking at a regular camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the reality, which means that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and use up a lot of recording storage space.
