<h3>Top Home Security Companies in Florida</h3>

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
