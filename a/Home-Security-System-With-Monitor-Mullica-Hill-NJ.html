<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stand apart too much. Pretty easy to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from far from your house. The 2nd crucial thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably shrill in-built alarm, so it works as a home alarm in addition to a security camera. That separates it from the products I have actually currently written, and helps in part to explain its price.</p>
