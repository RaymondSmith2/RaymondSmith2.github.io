The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, and so we may revisit this review.
