<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control panel (typically positioned in the entryway hall) that is used to arm and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have actually been activated, smart alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've already left home, and alerts you if any of the sensors have been activated, rather than getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly bothersome your neighbours).

<p>Among the best aspects of this alarm is that it has a very advanced motion sensing unit.
