<p>We searched for DIY systems that provided professional monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies offer complimentary or heavily affordable hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to five years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some people may wish to sign up for service only for when they or their partner is out of town, for instance. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and allow you to be in total control of the equipment you utilize, as well as how and when you pay and utilize for monitoring services.</p>

Naturally, you might wish to think about acquiring a security camera or 2 to accompany your system, but going with the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 total) is a bit more costly than Frontpoint's a lot of basic package for $320 (or $255 with the 20% advertising offer), which does not include a camera.</p>
