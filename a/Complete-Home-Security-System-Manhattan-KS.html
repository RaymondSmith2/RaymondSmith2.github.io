<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
