<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the whole family will like. ADT is a household name, so we regularly try out their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task.

We think their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint.

<p>Security: There have actually been lots of headings about hackers compromising home cameras, baby screens, and other Wi-Fi devices to spy on people, so make sure to check what actions has each producer required to remove this problem.

In the London subway bombings in 2005, terrorists brought bombs onto buses and trains, detonating them throughout rush hour. After the tragic attacks, authorities examined CCTV camera video footage and saw the terrorists going into the train station, carrying backpacks filled with explosives.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
