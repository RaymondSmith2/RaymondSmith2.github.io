Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
