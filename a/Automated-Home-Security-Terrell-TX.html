<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
