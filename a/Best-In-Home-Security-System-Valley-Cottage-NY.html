<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. ADT also has more market experience and more monitoring centers than SimpliSafe.

Plus, it is compatible with Nest products, Google Assistant and Amaxon Alexa, and the brand also provides a range of cameras, sensing units and expert sirens, making it quite versatile.

Lots of systems use smart device apps as a control, which could offer both the person with a disability and a caretaker access to the system.</p>

Most wireless alarm work with home automation features. The apparent benefits are security and convenience, however home automation also helps to trim down those pesky energy bills. That's cash in the bank. That said, we have definitely no other qualms about the Swann's motion detection qualifications - it's satisfies in terms of sensitivity, avoiding false positives in our tests and throwing in heat detection as an included perk. It's quick to send an alert and hassle-free  in terms of storage given that it supports both cloud uploading and an on-board microSD card for each camera.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
