<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire household will enjoy. ADT is a household name, so we often experiment with their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task. In our most current round of testing, we understood that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor. We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty hectic with cool clever home functions. We specifically liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>

Just like their indoor counterparts, outdoor cameras connect to your Wi-Fi network and permit you to view live video from your phone. They are relatively easy to install, but if you're not familiar or comfy with electrical circuitry, you may want to have an expert electrical expert get the job done.</p>

IP cameras that are connected to the same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop notices (and recording, since it does that even when notifications are off).
