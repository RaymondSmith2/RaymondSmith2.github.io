<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound however subtle changes to the character of our public areas.

As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals may learn to be cautious about the books and regulars they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers.
