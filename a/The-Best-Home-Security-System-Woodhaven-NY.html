<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
