<p>So, while alarm may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute considerably to police capability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers fund police reaction to alarmed homes) a expensive and inefficient  approach to burglary reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Flood sensing units do not avoid water from entering your home, they just notify you as quickly as moisture is detected.
