Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>ADT puts your privacy first, and we do not sell your individual information. Blue by ADT items utilize login failure lockout and password strength reinforcement, in addition to encryption innovation. With 6.2 million consumers, ADT is the most relied on name in home security.
