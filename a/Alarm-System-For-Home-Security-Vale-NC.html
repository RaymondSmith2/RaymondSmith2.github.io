<p>Finally, the Police Department and the Village frequently get requests to waive incorrect alarm fees. By regulation, only incorrect alarms caused by hurricanes, twisters, earthquake or other catastrophic occasions, go through appeal. Alarms activated by electrical storms, thunder, hail, or abrupt modifications in temperature level do not satisfy the requirements for waiver of incorrect alarm costs.

All systems permit you to adjust the level of sensitivity of the motion detection and it's worth playing with these to prevent getting false alarms when the cat walk past. You can also change some cameras to only take a look at certain places - an entrance for instance.</p>

<p>We needed guards for our yearly Coats for the Cold event to secure the line camping tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to begin the heater at 5am. The first guard showed up early so he could look at the entire location and speak to me about my issues. He was professional, considerate and extremely comforting.
