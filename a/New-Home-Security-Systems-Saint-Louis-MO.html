<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and a phenomenal value. It gets an Exceptional rating for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.

Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
