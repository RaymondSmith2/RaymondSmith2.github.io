With years of experience monitoring and setting up video and audio security systems for Seattle organisations and homes, we have actually built terrific relationships with both local police and their consumers. Also, do not forget that your wireless network security can be often weak, and susceptible to exploits.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
