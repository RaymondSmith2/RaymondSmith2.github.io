<p>The loudest of the smart alarm systems we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at warning anyone in your house and those close-by that there's a problem. Throughout screening, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we love that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to represent animals, too. The alarm system is just one of 2 we checked that includes an external siren, and we're amazed that it also includes a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, further dissuading anyone from attempting to break in to your home.
