<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. With years of experience installing and monitoring video and audio security systems for Seattle services and homes, we've built excellent relationships with both local police forces and their customers. Also, do not forget that your wireless network security can be sometimes weak, and susceptible to exploits.

It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually identified (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Downsides: exceptionally sensitive to weather; as snow, fog, and rain, for example, would cause the sensing units to stop working, and need sterilized boundary line since trees and bushes or anything that obstructs the beam would cause incorrect alarm or lack of detection.
