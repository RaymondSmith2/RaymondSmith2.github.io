Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
