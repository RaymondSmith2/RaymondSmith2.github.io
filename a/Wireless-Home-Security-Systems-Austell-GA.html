<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were typically missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.
