If you bought cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cord behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that indicates you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. You can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax infrastructure if you buy HD-CCTV security system.

When determining how much a burglar alarm costs consumers need to understand that if they add more functions, the rate will increase.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
