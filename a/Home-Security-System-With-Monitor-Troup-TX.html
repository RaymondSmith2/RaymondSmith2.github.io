<p>This cool smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During testing, we discovered it was basic to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was found. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey. It's also worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
