<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our screening, must provide at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to correctly find motion and not get stuck recording on a loop.
