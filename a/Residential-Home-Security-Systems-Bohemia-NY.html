<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
