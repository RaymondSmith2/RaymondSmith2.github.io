<p>Due to the fact that it's more complex than it needs to be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked.
