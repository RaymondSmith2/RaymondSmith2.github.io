<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and scams. Suggestion: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We need to again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating expensive incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it instantly turn off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can automatically make the smart lights turn on to frighten potential robbers.</p>
