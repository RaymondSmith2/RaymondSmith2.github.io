When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).

<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing.
