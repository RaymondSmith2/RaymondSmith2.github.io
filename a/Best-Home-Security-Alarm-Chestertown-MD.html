These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical misconception is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free.

Window sensing units are easily hid behind drapes or blinds, and door sensing units are so small that they tend to blend into the doorframe.
