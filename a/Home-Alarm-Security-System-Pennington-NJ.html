<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and reduce criminal activity. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, and so we may revisit this review. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video to the cloud.
