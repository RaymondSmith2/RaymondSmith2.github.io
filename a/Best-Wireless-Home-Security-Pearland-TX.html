<p>Our alarm systems might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an infraction. As soon as a zone has actually been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line.
