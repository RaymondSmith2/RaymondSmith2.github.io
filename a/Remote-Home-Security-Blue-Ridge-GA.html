Of course, the obvious disadvantage to a wired security system is that the initial install can be pricey. If the system was not installed throughout the homebuilding process, setting one up might need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and accessing to challenging spots that are sealed off in basements or attics. Wired security systems are also susceptible to power interruptions. Many will have a backup battery system that switches on in case of a failure, but long term blackouts will lead to the system losing power. When choosing a wired system, it's also important to consider how long you prepare to remain at the very same residence. Since these security systems are integrated into the home's wiring, they are not portable and can't move with you.</p>
