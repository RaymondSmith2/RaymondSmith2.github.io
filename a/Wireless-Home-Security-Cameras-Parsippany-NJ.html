<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Fantastic clearness. I wanted to establish seeing on my cell phone but had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter signals, for instance. However, those functions come at a relatively steep cost: $5 monthly ($50 each year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 each year) for thirty days of video history.  For each additional camera, the membership is discounted to about half of the preliminary fee.

<p>Pay attention to the existing lighting in the areas where you wish to install security cameras. Try to find the night vision variety of each camera and think about how much location you want to cover.

<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a need to for usage when you're far from home, however you shouldn't have to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming.
