<p>Among IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the web. Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the easiest alternative to install and all of the tape-recorded video is kept in the cloud.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that they don't have to be located near an Ethernet port and do not need wiring, wi-fi cameras are simpler to install than their wired equivalents. Battery-powered Wi-Fi cameras are the easiest to install because you can put them practically anywhere (as long as they can connect to your router) without needing to snake a power cable into your home to plug into an outlet. These types of cameras normally use rechargeable batteries that can be quickly popped out and taken indoors for charging with a USB cable, however they tend to drain pipes quickly in cooler weather. Bluetooth cameras are likewise simple to install, but you need to remain within 40 feet approximately to link to them with your phone.</p>
