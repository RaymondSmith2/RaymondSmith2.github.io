Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
