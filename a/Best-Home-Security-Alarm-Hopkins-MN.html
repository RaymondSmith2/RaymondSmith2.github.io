<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
