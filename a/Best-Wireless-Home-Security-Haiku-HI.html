<h3>Best House Alarm System in Haiku HI</h3>

<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>

Rather, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a typical self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or trigger the siren.
