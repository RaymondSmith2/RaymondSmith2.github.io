<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server run by the manufacturer, instead of at your house) is the standard these days, but some cameras keep recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected hard drive.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the store.
