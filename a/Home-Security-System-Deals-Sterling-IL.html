<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
<p>With a child en route, you might want to include a camera to your nursery - no issue. When your kids become more mobile, you can add additional sensors to kitchen cabinets or the freezer.
