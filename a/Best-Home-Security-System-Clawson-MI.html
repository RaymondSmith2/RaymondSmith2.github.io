The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to solve detail after the reality, which suggests that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of tape-recording storage space.
