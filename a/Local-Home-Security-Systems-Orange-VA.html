Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
