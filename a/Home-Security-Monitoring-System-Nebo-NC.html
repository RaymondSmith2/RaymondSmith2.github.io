<p>Analog security cameras transfer lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by.

To recoup costs and hold alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you.
