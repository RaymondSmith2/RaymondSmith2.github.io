<p>Thanks to current developments in innovation, wireless security systems are now as effective as wired systems If you've decided to install a burglar alarm, you need to consider the following advantages of wireless innovation. The $260 Basics package includes the base station, a keypad, four entry sensors, one motion sensor, a yard indication, and 2 window decals.

Though it's less costly than our other choices, packages start at a couple hundred dollars and go up from there. On the plus side, purchasing your equipment upfront does offer you the flexibility to move or cancel your system at any time.</p>
