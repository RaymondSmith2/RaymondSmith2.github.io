<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be considered.

Should be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
