<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
