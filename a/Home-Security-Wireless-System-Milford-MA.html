<p>The majority of modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which allow operators to enjoy some of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup.

Frequently, the simple presence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated trespassers. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more determined intruders. They might also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks if burglars can not see any security cameras.</p>
