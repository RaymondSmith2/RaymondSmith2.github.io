Well, it's a packaged security set that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring costs. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you pick the complimentary self-monitor" choice.</p>

Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, clever lock, and so on), I want to make sure that they all quickly interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>

The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and tape-recorded clips, along with when we made changes in the settings.</p>
