Theft prevention is an essential precaution to make sure the safety of your valuables. A burglar alarm can serve several functions to this end. In many cases, its presence can act as a deterrent-- intruders are less apt to target a spot where it is more likely that they will experience such disturbance.

When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm.
