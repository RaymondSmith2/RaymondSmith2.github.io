<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
